# Cwill-Work-Portfolio

## Description

 This page is to give a little information about me and some of my projects I have worked on as I learn more about coding.
 I thought putting this together would be great for me to use what I have learned so far and put it into practice
 The items I have provided will help give you an understanding of some of the skills i have learned so far as well as provide a little information about myself.
 This project has helped me learn how to combine all of the components that I have learned so far into one, allowing me to build this page from scratch. I had fun buildin it and hope to continue to customize it the more I learn.
